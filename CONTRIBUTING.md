# Contributing to pytest-pyspec

Contributions of all kinds are welcome! The easiest way to help is:

1. **Open an issue** describing the bug, enhancement, doc idea, or testing effort you have in mind.
2. **Discuss the idea** in the issue so we can confirm the scope/approach together.
3. **Submit a pull request** (code, docs, or tests) once there’s agreement on the plan.

This keeps the project focused and avoids duplicated work. Thanks for helping make pytest-pyspec better!
